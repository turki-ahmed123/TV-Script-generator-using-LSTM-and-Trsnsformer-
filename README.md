# TV-Script-generator-using-LSTM-and-Trsnsformer-
This project builds and compares two text-generation models: an LSTM and a Transformer. The LSTM learns short-range patterns and generates simple sequences, while the Transformer uses attention to capture long-range context and produce more coherent, fluent text.
